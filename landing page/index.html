    <h3><b><i>Why come to Canada?</i></b></h3>
    <p style="color:green;">
    Canada is a large, diverse country with a lot going for it, but most tourists are drawn to a few of the same things:</p>
    <dl>

      <dt>Nature</dt><dd>- Canada is one of the most beautiful countries in the world, full of picturesque forests, mountains, and lakes that make it a fantastic place for camping, hiking, or just wandering around and admiring.</dd>

      <dt>Winter Sports</dt><dd>- Canada’s snowy climate and mountainous geography has produced no shortage of must-visit parks and resorts for anyone interested in skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, or any other activity best enjoyed in the cold.</dd>

      <dt>Cities</dt><dd>- Canada is home to several large, modern cities that anyone with a taste for urban life will be able to appreciate.</dd>

      <dt>Cost</dt><dd>-The Canadian dollar is generally quite weak in comparison to other currencies, which make it a very affordable option for people without too much money in their travel budgets.</dd></p>
     <h3><b><i>What language do they speak in Canada?</i></b></h3>
    <p style="color:seagreen;"><i>
    Foreigners are sometimes confused by Canada’s language situation. Officially, Canada has two official languages, French and English. However, this is mostly just a matter of government policy. The vast majority of Canadians only speak English, and lack even basic skills in French. French-speaking tourists should not expect to speak French in cities like Vancouver, Toronto, or Calgary.<br><br>

The capital city of Ottawa is more functionally bilingual than most Canadian cities, and all museums and government-related attractions will feature signs and brochures in both French and English. Staff at popular attractions will likely be fluently bilingual as well, as will many employees of popular stores and restaurants. It helps to ask, however.<br><br>

The famous city of Montreal, in the province of Quebec, is the most bilingual city in Canada and most residents, particularly those who live and work in the downtown core, can speak fluent French and English. It is not considered controversial in Montreal to speak either French or English to a stranger and assume the other person will understand. In other parts of Quebec, however, rates of English fluency are much lower and it may be considered offensive to speak English to a stranger without first asking for permission.</i></p>

     <h3 class="kp"><b>Top Attractions in Canada</b></h3></center>
     <dl>
       <dt><i><b> 1&gt; Niagara Falls, Canadian Side</i></b></dt><dd>-Niagara Falls is a group of three waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge, spanning the border between the province of Ontario in Canada and the state of New York in the United States. The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls, which straddles the international border of the two countries.[1] It is also known as the Canadian Falls.[2] The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie within the United States. Bridal Veil Falls is separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat Island and from American Falls by Luna Island, with both islands situated in New York.</dd><br><center><img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1275716095/photo/niagara-falls-autumn-landscape.jpg?b=1&s=170667a&w=0&k=20&c=9-NVDcnpAVth40Iq4sfPDQGfM_SLxS04N7j6P35nI7c="width="580"heigth="440"><br></center>

It attracts more than one million visitors every year, making the ROM the most-visited museum in Canada.[2] The museum is north of Queen's Park, in the University of Toronto district, with its main entrance on Bloor Street West.

       <dt><i><b> 3&gt; Calgary Tower</i></b></dt><dd>-The Calgary Tower is a 190.8-meter (626 ft) free standing observation tower in the downtown core of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Originally called the Husky Tower, it was conceived as a joint venture between Marathon Realty Company Limited and Husky Oil as part of an urban renewal plan and to celebrate Canada's centennial of 1967. The tower was built at a cost of CA$3,500,000 and weighs approximately 10,884 tonnes, of which 60% is below ground. It opened to the public on June 30, 1968 as the tallest structure in Calgary, and the tallest in Canada outside Toronto. It was renamed the Calgary Tower in 1971.</dd><br><center><img src="https://www.thebestcalgary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Amazing-Things-You-Can-Do-at-Calgary-Tower-1-1024x576.jpg"width="580"heigth="440"><br></center>

With a maximum elevation of over 1,200m (4,100ft) at its peak, the mountain is the site of an alpine ski area, Grouse Mountain Resort, which overlooks Metro Vancouver and has four chairlifts servicing 33 runs. In the summer, Grouse Mountain Resort features lumberjack shows, the "Birds in Motion" birds of prey demonstration, a scenic chairlift ride, disc golf, mountain biking, zip lining, tandem paragliding, helicopter tours, and guided ecowalks. Year-round operations include a 100-seat mountaintop theatre and a wildlife refuge. The mountain operates two aerial tramways, known officially as the Skyride. The Blue Skyride is used mainly for freight transportation, while public access to the mountain top is provided by the Swiss-built Garaventa Red Skyride, which has a maximum capacity of 101 passengers (96 in summer). Summer access is also provided by the 2.9 kilometre Grouse Grind hiking trail, which is open for hiking from May to October.</dd><br><center><img src="http://snowbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/grouse-mountains-vancouver.jpg"width="580"heigth="440"><br></center>
